Flamingo add-on for email confirmation.

== Description ==

When an user submits a Contact Form 7 and the Flamingo gets an incoming 
contact, the Cormorant emails to that contact with *confirmation link*,
if that contact is not confirmed yet.

When an user follows the *confirmation link*, the Cormorant adds the
*Confirmed tag* to the related Flamingo contact.

Cormorant can also email to the Wordpress admin to notify about a contact
confirmation.
